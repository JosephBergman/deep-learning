    "## Introduction \n",
    "In the previous post, we trained a convnet from scratch to classify photos as either \"food\" or \"notfood\". We used the [Food-5K](https://mmspg.epfl.ch/food-image-datasets) dataset, and we were able to achieve 84.3% test accuracy. In the process, we learned how to work with a real world dataset and use data augmentation to reduce overfitting in our bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are going to try to improve our Food vs. Not Food classifier by using pretrained networks. Pretained networks are models that have been previously trained on large, general image datasets. As a result, they provide more powerful feature extractors than we can learn on our own with our small dataset. Keras provides a number of pretrained models so we can easily incorporate them into our work. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by looking at some of the models provided by Keras, and then we will use one to improve our classifier. "

    "### How Were They Trained?\n",
    "These networks were mostly trained on ImageNet, which is summarized by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNe) as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. Over 14 million URLs of images have been hand-annotated by ImageNet to indicate what objects are pictured; in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided. ImageNet contains over 20 thousand categories; a typical category, such as \"balloon\" or \"strawberry\", contains several hundred images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many models have been trained on ImageNet due to the annual [ImageNet challenge](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification at large scale. One high level motivation is to allow researchers to compare progress in detection across a wider variety of objects -- taking advantage of the quite expensive labeling effort. Another motivation is to measure the progress of computer vision for large scale image indexing for retrieval and annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the challenge, the ImageNet dataset is trimmed to objects within 1000 categories. \n",

    "### Brief Summary of Models\n",
    "The [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/home/welcome) covers VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 which I will quickly summarize below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### VGG16\n",
    "As you may have noticed, neural networks have many hyperparameters: how many layers should there be, how many nodes should each layer have, etc. VGG-16 is a large neural network which tried to simplify this. Every convolution layer uses 3x3 filters with same padding, and all pooling layers are max-pool layers with 2x2 filters and strides (meaning they halve the input size). The number of filters in each convolution layer follows a \"powers of 2\" pattern: 64, 128, 256, 512, 512. There are two fully connected layers containing 4096 nodes each, and a final softmax layer with 1000 notes. As you can see, it is a fairly massive network with 138,357,544 weights. The \"16\" in \"VGG16\" refers to the fact that there are 16 layers with trainable weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the paper: [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ResNet50 \n",
    "Very deep neural networks are difficult to train because of vanishing/exploding gradients. ResNets try to solve this problem by using \"Residual Blocks\". In a residual block, the input to layer $l$ will also be fed directly into layer $l+1$. This makes it easy for layer $l$ to learn an identity function – which means that even if layer $l$ isn't helping the network, it at least won't be hurting the network. As a result, ResNets can be very deep networks enabling them to learn very high-level features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the paper: [Deep Residual Learning for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### InceptionV3\n",
    "Whereas VGG16 tried to simplify convnets by saying, \"Let's just always use 3x3 filters,\" Inception networks try to simplify convnets by saying, \"Let's just use every sized filter, for every layer, and let the network decide what works best.\" By using same padding with each convolution operation, an inception block can use 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, etc. filters in every layer of the network. There are some tricks to implementing this that reduce the number of computations by about a factor of 10, so I would recommend checking out the Coursera lecture on Inception nets or the original paper to understand the implementation. Of the three networks discussed, InceptionV3 has the best Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy, so we'll use it as our base model. \n",

    "## Using Pretrained Models \n",
    "VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 have been trained on very large datasets – far larger than our 2,500 food pictures. Because they have been trained on such a large dataset, they should have learned very general features about images. The idea behind using pretrained models is that we can use the pretrained convolutional layers to extract features from our image, then we can train our own densely connected layers to generate predictions. We are going to use InceptionV3 as our feature extractor and train a densely connected network using its outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below imports the InceptionV3 model (be patient while it downloads ⌚️👀). The parameters are pretty important to understand. `include_top=False` means we don't want to load the densely connected layers that were trained for predicting ImageNet. Instead, we just want to use the convolutional base to extract features, and we wil train our own classifier for classifying between food and non-food images. `weights='imagenet` means we want to use the pretrained weights from ImageNet. If you exclude this paramater the weights will be randomly initialized which won't be very helpful for extracting features. Finally, we specify the input shape we want to use."

    "### Combining Models\n",
    "Models can be combined as simply as layers in Keras. Combine your base and dense classifiers.\n",
